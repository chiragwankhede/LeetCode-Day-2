Day 2: 50-Day LeetCode Milestone Challenge! 🚀

Hey GitHub community! 👋 Today, I delved into two fascinating problems on LeetCode and here are my solutions.

Problem 1: Missing Number (Q268)
- Problem Statement:
  Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.
- Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳
- Approach:
  - Sum Approach: Using the Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) formula, I calculated the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers and subtracted the actual sum of the array elements to find the missing number.



Problem 2: Row with Maximum 1's (Q2643)
- Problem Statement:
  Given a binary matrix `mat` of size `n * m`, where each row is sorted in ascending order, find the row with the maximum number of 1's.
- Time Complexity: O(n*m) ⏳
- Approach:
  - Linear Search: I iterated through each row to count the number of 1's and kept track of the row with the maximum count.


Stay tuned for more updates on my LeetCode journey! 🚀

Happy coding! 😊
